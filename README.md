# trail-media

## Project Overview

This app will allow a user to search for walking/biking trails by providing a latitude and longitude. After the user has entered this information, they will be provided 
with the name of the city, the name of the trail, a description of the train, and directions. If the user signs up for an account and logs in, they will be able to 
post a comment about the trail.
